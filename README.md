# WebProject
The project was build with a mindset 

HR Administrator is a web application project
The project is all about storing updating and deleting an employees data
It has a login page to get into the main page and only the user having login id and password of application can get into the main page of employees data
****This login user_id and password are in a database. So when you enter id and password, the application will check those with the database 
****If it gets verified then only you can access in the application or the main page

After getting into the page the user can perform necessary actions with the employees data as required
The project is also connected with SQL database
Any update delete addition in the web page the data will also get changed in the database

For Example:- Office storing employees database
Suppose you are the HR of a company and you are to manage all the database of employees working in the company
So the company has an application for storing data of employees but it requires a user_id and password
And as you are the HR so the company will provide you the user_id and password to get into the application
So after getting verified with id and password you will get into the main page
Here the HR can add update or delete the data of an employee as required by the company
